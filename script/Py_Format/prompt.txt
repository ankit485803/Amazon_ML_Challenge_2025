We want to do very fast these work only 4 hrs to submiited with higher accuracy

step1: Data Load (both train.csv and test.csv) and Img data fetech from train.csv[image_link]
we don't want that all these img dowload locally in my laptop and compute resources because our dirctly fetech Dell Laptop window 11 i5 with 4 CPU cores

Is this the correct approach?

step2: Preprocessing and Feature Engg for textual data i.e. catalog_content, etc
and handling the other parameters

step3: Model Selection
use PyTorch and a transformer or higher-level neural network that predicts correctly and gives more accuracy
 that extracts both text and image features to predict product prices with regression methods.

step4: Train the models

step5: Print the accuracy metric along with Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE):

step6: Lastly, Predication  steps and export in this format test_out.csv file which have only two columns: sample_id and price
